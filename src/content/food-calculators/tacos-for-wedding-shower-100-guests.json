    "foodTips": [
      "Elegant, bite-sized foods are the gold standard - tea sandwiches, fruit skewers, mini quiches.",
      "Sweet treats are essential - petit fours, macarons, and a beautiful cake or cupcakes.",
      "Plan 5-7 savory pieces and 2-3 sweet pieces per guest for a 2-3 hour event.",
      "Presentation matters more than quantity - use tiered trays and beautiful serving pieces.",
      "Dietary accommodations are essential - have vegetarian and gluten-free clearly labeled."
    ],
    "foodBuyingGuide": "Bridal showers call for elegant finger foods. Think tea sandwiches, fresh fruit displays, cheese boards, and beautiful desserts. Plan $12-20 per person for a nice spread. Avoid anything messy or requiring utensils.",
    "proTips": [
      "Mimosa bars are the gold standard. Stock 1 bottle of sparkling per 3 guests, plus orange juice and peach nectar for variety.",
      "Skip heavy reds. Go 70% white/rosé (Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc) and 30% light red (Pinot Noir).",
      "Create one signature cocktail (Aperol Spritz, French 75) and batch it ahead of time - plan 2 servings per guest.",
      "25-30% of guests won't drink alcohol. Offer elegant non-alcoholic options like mocktails or flavored sparkling water.",
      "Afternoon timing means lower consumption - most guests have 1-2 drinks max."
    ],
    "buyingGuide": "For a 2-3 hour afternoon shower, plan for 1.3 drinks per guest. Champagne and wine dominate - stock 1 bottle of sparkling per 3 guests for mimosas, plus 1 wine bottle per 2 drinking guests. Buy 10-15% extra; unopened bottles can be returned or saved for the wedding. Prosecco is cost-effective for mimosas; save real Champagne for the toast."
