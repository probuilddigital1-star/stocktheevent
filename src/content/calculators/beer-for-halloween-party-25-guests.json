    "foodBuyingGuide": "Halloween parties are all about presentation. Themed appetizers with spooky names, finger foods that won't mess up costumes, and plenty of candy. Budget for presentation supplies like themed plates and decorations.",
    "proTips": [
      "Specialty cocktails with spooky names are a must - batch them ahead.",
      "Dark spirits (whiskey, dark rum) fit the theme better than clear spirits.",
      "Punch bowls with dry ice create amazing effects.",
      "People in elaborate costumes drink slower - they don't want to spill.",
      "Adult-only parties consume 40% more than family Halloween events."
    ],
    "buyingGuide": "Halloween parties are cocktail-heavy. Plan for 2-3 specialty cocktails per person plus regular bar options. Red wine fits the theme well. Have themed cups and garnishes."
