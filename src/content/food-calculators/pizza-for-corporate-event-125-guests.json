      "Elegant finger foods that don't require utensils or create mess are ideal.",
      "Vegetarian and dietary options are essential - plan 30% of your spread as veg-friendly.",
      "Shorter events (2-3 hours) need less food - plan 4-5 appetizer pieces per person.",
      "Evening events consume 25% more food than lunch events.",
      "Avoid foods that stain (red sauces, turmeric) - people are in work clothes."
    ],
    "foodBuyingGuide": "Corporate events require elevated finger foods. Think caprese skewers, shrimp cocktail, bruschetta, and elegant cheese boards. Avoid anything too casual or messy. Budget $8-15 per person for appetizers at a cocktail reception.",
    "proTips": [
      "Most corporate guests self-limit to 2 drinks max - don't over-order.",
      "Wine outsells beer 3:1 at corporate events - flip your usual ratio.",
      "40% of corporate guests leave within 90 minutes - peak consumption is minutes 15-60.",
      "Weekday events consume 35% less than Friday events.",
      "Always have premium non-alcoholic options prominently displayed."
    ],
    "buyingGuide": "Focus on quality over quantity for corporate events. Stock premium wines and craft options rather than bulk quantities. Have elegant non-alcoholic options visible - many professionals choose not to drink at work functions. A sophisticated sparkling water with citrus is always appreciated."
