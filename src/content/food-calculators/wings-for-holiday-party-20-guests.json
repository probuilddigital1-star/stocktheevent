      "Holiday appetizers should be elevated - cheese boards, shrimp cocktail, stuffed mushrooms.",
      "Sweet treats are expected - have a dessert station with cookies and holiday candies.",
      "Warm appetizers disappear 40% faster in winter - plan accordingly.",
      "Dietary restrictions matter more at holidays - have vegetarian and gluten-free options clearly labeled.",
      "If it's a potluck, assume 30% of guests will forget to bring something."
    ],
    "foodBuyingGuide": "Holiday parties are about elevated comfort food. Plan 8-10 appetizer pieces per person for a cocktail-style party. Include a mix of hot and cold options, with at least one 'showstopper' like a cheese board or charcuterie spread.",
    "proTips": [
      "Red wine outsells white 2:1 at winter holidays - adjust accordingly.",
      "Festive signature cocktails are expected - plan for mixers like cranberry juice and eggnog.",
      "70% of champagne at NYE is consumed between 11:30pm and 12:15am - time your chilling.",
      "Warm drinks like mulled wine and hot toddies are crowd pleasers in cold months.",
      "People drink 20% more at company holiday parties than other corporate events."
    ],
    "buyingGuide": "Holiday parties call for festive options. Stock extra red wine and have ingredients for 1-2 seasonal cocktails (mulled wine, spiked cider, or classic eggnog). For NYE specifically, double your champagne order and have everything chilled by 11pm."
