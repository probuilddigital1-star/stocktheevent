      "Cake reduces other food consumption by 20% - factor this into your planning.",
      "Kids' birthday parties need 30% less food per person - shorter attention spans.",
      "Adult milestone birthdays (30, 40, 50) eat more - people linger longer.",
      "Late-night birthdays need late-night food - pizza arrives around 10pm.",
      "Set up food before activities and cake - people graze while waiting."
    ],
    "foodBuyingGuide": "Birthday party food depends heavily on the age group. Kids' parties: pizza and simple finger foods. Young adult birthdays: pizza, wings, and shareable platters. 40+ birthdays: more sophisticated appetizers and seated options.",
    "proTips": [
      "Milestone birthdays (21st, 30th, 40th, 50th) consume 25% more than regular birthdays.",
      "Birthday parties have 3x more shots than any other event type - stock shooters.",
      "Consumption drops 60% during cake and presents - factor in 30-45 min of low drinking.",
      "Know your crowd's age - 21-30 year olds drink 30% more beer, 50+ drink 35% more wine.",
      "Consider a signature 'birthday cocktail' to make the guest of honor feel special."
    ],
    "buyingGuide": "Birthday parties vary wildly by age group. For 21-35, stock up on beer and mixers for cocktails. For 40+, increase your wine selection. Always have extra for milestone birthdays - people celebrate harder at 30, 40, and 50."
