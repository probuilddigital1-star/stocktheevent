      "Plan 6-8 appetizer pieces per guest for a 1-hour cocktail hour before dinner.",
      "Sliders are a late-night hit after dancing starts - plan 2 per guest for after 10pm.",
      "If serving tacos, offer 3 protein options minimum for dietary variety.",
      "Food trucks are trendy - plan 20% extra as guests tend to go back for seconds.",
      "Passed appetizers disappear 40% faster than stationed ones - plan accordingly."
    ],
    "foodBuyingGuide": "For wedding receptions, appetizers during cocktail hour are essential. Plan 6-8 pieces per guest for a 1-hour cocktail hour. If you're doing late-night snacks (pizza, sliders, tacos), plan for 70% of guests still present to eat again around 10-11pm.",
    "proTips": [
      "40% of all alcohol is consumed during cocktail hour - front-load your bar staff and ice.",
      "Offer 1-2 signature cocktails instead of a full bar to cut spirit costs by 40% and speed up service.",
      "Pre-pour wine at dinner tables 5 minutes before guests sit to prevent service bottlenecks.",
      "Order 10-15% extra and ask vendors about their return policy on unopened bottles.",
      "If dancing goes past 10pm, reopen a simplified bar: beer, wine, and 2 signature drinks only."
    ],
    "buyingGuide": "For weddings, plan a 60/40 split between red and white wine for fall/winter, or flip it for spring/summer. Budget $12-18 per bottle for a crowd-pleasing selection - guests can't tell the difference between $15 and $40 wine at a party. Consider having champagne for toasts separate from your open bar calculation."
