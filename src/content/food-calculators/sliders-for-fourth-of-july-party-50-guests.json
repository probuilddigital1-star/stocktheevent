    ],
    "foodBuyingGuide": "4th of July is about grilled meats and outdoor eating. Plan 1 burger/hot dog + 1 side per person, or 6oz pulled pork with buns. Keep everything fresh with plenty of ice. Watermelon and cold sides are essential in summer heat.",
    "proTips": [
      "Outdoor heat increases beer consumption by 25% - have more than you think.",
