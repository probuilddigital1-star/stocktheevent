      "40% of all alcohol is consumed during cocktail hour - front-load your bar staff and ice.",
      "Offer 1-2 signature cocktails instead of a full bar to cut spirit costs by 40% and speed up service.",
      "Pre-pour wine at dinner tables 5 minutes before guests sit to prevent service bottlenecks.",
      "Order 10-15% extra and ask vendors about their return policy on unopened bottles.",
      "If dancing goes past 10pm, reopen a simplified bar: beer, wine, and 2 signature drinks only."
    ],
    "buyingGuide": "For weddings, plan a 60/40 split between red and white wine for fall/winter, or flip it for spring/summer. Budget $12-18 per bottle for a crowd-pleasing selection - guests can't tell the difference between $15 and $40 wine at a party. Consider having champagne for toasts separate from your open bar calculation."
