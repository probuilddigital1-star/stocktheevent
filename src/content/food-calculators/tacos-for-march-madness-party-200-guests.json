    "foodTips": [
      "Tournament games can run 2+ hours each - plan for sustained snacking, not a single meal.",
      "Bracket pools mean people arrive at different times - keep food stations refreshed.",
      "Wings and pizza are the classic combo - plan for both.",
      "Overtime games increase consumption by 25% - have backup food ready.",
      "Multiple TV setups mean multiple food stations - don't make people miss the game."
    ],
    "foodBuyingGuide": "March Madness is similar to Super Bowl but spread over multiple games. Wings, pizza, and shareable appetizers are ideal. Plan 8-10 wings and 2-3 pizza slices per person per game session.",
    "proTips": [
      "Games run back-to-back during opening weekend - people may stay 6-8 hours.",
      "Stock light beers for marathon watching sessions.",
      "Multiple games mean multiple peaks - don't front-load everything.",
      "Have non-alcoholic options for designated drivers and early bracket busts.",
      "Weekend games have 30% higher consumption than weekday games."
    ],
    "buyingGuide": "March Madness parties are beer-heavy but lighter than Super Bowl (longer duration, people pace themselves). Stock 70% light beers. Have coolers at every TV location. Plan 4-5 beers per person for a 4-hour session."
