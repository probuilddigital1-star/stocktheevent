      "Late-night food is essential - sliders or pizza around 12:30am.",
      "Heavy apps early, lighter as midnight approaches.",
      "Sweet treats for after midnight - champagne and dessert pair perfectly.",
      "Breakfast items for really late parties - mini quiches, bacon strips."

    "foodBuyingGuide": "NYE is about elegant appetizers and champagne. Plan 8-10 appetizer pieces per person for the main event, plus late-night snacks for after midnight. End with something sweet.",
    "proTips": [
      "70% of champagne is consumed between 11:30pm and 12:15am - time your chilling.",
      "Have champagne COLD and ready to pour at 11:55pm.",
      "People pace themselves until 10pm then drinking accelerates.",
      "Late-night parties need designated drivers or Uber - plan ahead.",
      "Noisemakers and party favors should be near the champagne station."
    ],
    "buyingGuide": "This is THE champagne event. Plan 1 bottle per 3-4 guests for the midnight toast, plus additional for cocktails (French 75s, Kir Royale). Have regular bar options for earlier in the evening. Stock more than you think - better to have leftovers than run out at midnight."
