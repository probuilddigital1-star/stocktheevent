    "foodTips": [
      "Graduation parties often span 4+ hours - plan for grazing, not a sit-down meal.",
      "Young adults eat more than you think - add 20% to your calculations for ages 18-25.",
      "Set up a separate kids' food station with pizza and sliders to keep parents happy.",
      "Outdoor graduation parties need food that won't spoil - keep hot foods hot and cold foods cold.",
      "Photo ops happen constantly - finger foods beat anything requiring utensils."
    ],
    "foodBuyingGuide": "Graduation parties are grazing events. Finger foods work best - pizza slices, sliders, wings, and appetizers that guests can grab while mingling. If your graduate is 21+, expect their friends to eat AND drink more than the older guests.",
    "proTips": [
      "Set up a visible '21+ only' bar area and a killer mocktail station so younger guests feel included.",
      "Parents of graduates drink about 30% less than the graduate's friends - plan your ratios accordingly.",
      "Keep champagne cold but corked until group photo time - pop bottles for the shot!",
      "Outdoor graduations in summer need extra cold drinks and 2x the ice you think you need.",
      "Mix of generations means variety is key - have options for every age group."
    ],
    "buyingGuide": "Graduation parties typically skew toward beer and lighter drinks. Stock up on popular light beers and have a good selection of non-alcoholic options since many guests will be under 21. Sparkling cider is a great champagne alternative for toasts that includes everyone."
